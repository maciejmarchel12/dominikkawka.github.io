 <h3>Spaghetti and marshmellow challenge</h3>

 <p>Our tower fell, but It thought us to learn by trail and error, and not to try to make one big plan and fail<p>

 <h3>UI and UX</h3>

 <p>User interface >> Displaying the information needed and is easy to read eg Minecraft with the hotbar,health,hunger,exp and armour </p>

 <p>User eXperience >> Does the website have a meaning, a dedicated audience</p>

     </h3>We started to learn JavaScript </h3>
     <ul class="list">
     <li class="list">var Age = "15";</li>
     <li class="list">console.log(true);</li>
     <li class="list">console.log(false);</li>

     <li class="list">console.log(33);</li>
     <li class="list">console.log("woo");</li>
     </ul>
     <p>You can also do console.log(3 + 4). Subtract(-) Multiply(Asterik) and Divide (/) </p>

     <p>console.log("gdhasuidbasuio".length) Shows how many characters the thing in the quotes has (It has 14)</p>

     <p>console.log("ndsiao".toUpperCase()); Makes "ndsiao" all uppercase</p>

     <h3> Codeacademy </h3>
      
     <p>Math.random() generates a number between 1 and 0</p>
     <p>Math.floor() rounds up or down a number</p>
     <p>Math.floor(Math.random() * 50); Multiplies the number by 50</p>
     <p>console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))</p>

     <p><b>I personally feel that with Code academy is a bad way to learn, after half an hour I already can't remember most of the things that I've done.</b></p>

     <h3>Breakout</h3>

     <p>The breakout game went well, I was able to get most of the things working and I knew what most of the code meant</p>
     <p>I couldn't get the collision to work so I had to look up a solution. </p>
     <p>Another problem - Whenever I would make the table for the ping pong, all the props would disappear; Fixed > Moved some of the coding and it worked</p>
     <p>I refuse to make mouse controls for a game like this. Instead I made the paddle move with the left and right arrow keys</p></div>

          <p>The first thing that we did was that we went to the WIT arena to some convention,then we went to a research lab, we were able to play around with AR. We also got some red hat fidget spinners.  We reviewed our websites again and started to talk about more features that we wanted to add.</p>
          <p> This led us into talking login and register features, which we started to do later on the evening.  We started to get into bootstrap also. I spent most of my time trying to make the button look nice :< </p> </div>
